# BalatroMods

# Installation
- Install [lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation)
- Navigate to your mods/saves directory:
 - Windows: cd %AppData%/Balatro
 - Mac: cd ~/Library/Application Support/Balatro
 - Linux (WINE/Proton): cd ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2379780/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Balatro
- Download the mod into the mods directory, either:
  - Clone directly from Git using `git clone https://github.com/Ratakor/BalatroMods Mods --recursive`
  - Download the repository as a .zip file and extract it into the `Mods` foler

I recommand to manually add `.lovelyignore` files to each mods you don't want before first launching the game with this mod pack.
Also I've added some [additional mods](./additional_mods) that are not included in the main folder because they change the game too much or may break things, it's easy to enable them via a symlink or just by moving the directory.
