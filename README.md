# BalatroMods

# Installation
- Install [lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation)
- Navigate to your mods/saves directory:
  - Windows: `%AppData%/Balatro`
  - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Balatro`
  - Linux (WINE/Proton): `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2379780/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Balatro`
- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Ratakor/BalatroMods Mods --recursive`

I recommand running [disable_all.sh](./disable_all.sh) or manually adding
`.lovelyignore` files to each mods you don't want before first launching the
game with this mod pack.
