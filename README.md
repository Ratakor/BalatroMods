# BalatroMods

# Installation
- Install [lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation)
- Navigate to your mods/saves directory:
  - Windows: cd %AppData%/Balatro
  - Mac: cd ~/Library/Application Support/Balatro
  - Linux (WINE/Proton): cd ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2379780/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Balatro
- Download the mod into the mods directory, either:
  - Clone directly from Git using `git clone https://github.com/Ratakor/BalatroMods Mods --recursive`
  - Download the repository as a .zip file and extract it into the `Mods` foler

I recommand to manually add `.lovelyignore` files to each mods you don't want
before first launching the game with this mod pack.
